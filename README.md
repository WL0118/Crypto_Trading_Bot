# Crypto_Trading_Bot
** * Only for study, I recommend running this bot with the 'dyrun' mode on the Freqtrade system.*  **


This trading bot runs on the 'Freqtrade' as a strategy. The model used in the bot indicates critical price-increasing signals. 
It is made of LightGBM including statistical trading indicators as well as many manipulated features such as price difference between crypto markets.



## The Model


### 1. Dowload Datasets.
This model uses data sets from two different crypto markets to extract features related to the a same crypto-currency price difference between from two markets.
I got 1-min candle data from the Binance market and 1-day candle data from the Upbit market by using each Rest API.

### 2. Training set


## Freaqtrade strategy
